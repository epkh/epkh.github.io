                <h1>Is the Middle Class Left Out in Pennsylvania?</h1>
	            <h3>A Look at Middle Class Housing Burden in the Keystone State</h3><br>
	            

                <p>Starting with the Great Recession and increasing with the 2016 Presidential Election, people across the United States started to realize that large parts of the US were being left out of political and social narratives.<br> 
                
                <br>In many places across the US, wages are increasing at a much lower rate than housing costs are. Housing cost burden is the percent of a household's total income that is spent on housing, whether that is rent or a mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities.<br>

                <br>With a large middle class, a history as a successful rustbelt state, and home to an increasingly polarized rural and urban population, Pennsylvania is a state that epitomizes these 21st century tensions.<br>
              

                <br>Is the middle class in Pennsylvania becoming more vulnerable over time, and if so, could this explain why such polarizing tensions exist in a once booming state? This project examines the middle class across Pennsylvania over the past ten years, but who is a part of the middle class? <br>

                </p>

                <h3>Who is in the Middle Class?</h3>

                Housing burden is a metric often used to determine what housing support the most vulnerable households should receive from the government.<br> <br>
                But how is this middle class faring without the support of the government safety net? Are middle-income renters and homeowners experiencing different levels of housing cost burden across the state? Are a greater percentage of middle class households in rural areas experiencing housing burdens than those in urban areas?

            <p>In 2005, no matter where you were in Pennsylvania, at least 27% of middle-income renters and 17% of middle-income homeowners were housing cost burdened. <br><br>

            In 2010, burden was more widespread. <b>Many areas saw the highest rates of housing cost-burden in 2010.</b> While in 2015, many areas saw a decline in the percentage of households with cost-burden, households in eastern Pennsylvania continued to experience greater cost burden than those in the rest of the state, both homeowners and renters alike.  <br><br>

            Looking at Pennsylvania over time also reveals that the distribution of housing cost burden is becoming more of an urban issue. Between 2005 and 2010, percent of cost-burdened middle-income renter households in the city of Philadelphia increased from 57% to 60%, and remained at that level in 2015.</p>

            <p>After a peak in 2010, in 2015 the total number of burdened middle class households is the least of any of the years we explored, and 
            <b>the number of burdened homeowning households decreases while the number of burdened renters increases.</b> This phenomenon could be for a number of reasons: Burdened homeowners may have downsized, and now are no longer burdened by their housing costs, they may have sold their houses, and are now renters, or their wages may have gone up - in fact, unemployment rate in Pennsylvania peaked in 2010 and has been decreasing ever since.<br><br>

            What we do know is that <b>from 2005 to 2015 the burdened households, both renting and homeowning, have become more concentrated around urban areas, especially Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.</b><br>

            <br>This final visualization shows the distribution of all burdened households across the state in 2015, demonstrating how <b>burden is concentrated around urban areas,</b> and also allows individual investigation into the renter/homeowner breakdown in each area of the state.<br><br>

            There are some exceptions to this trend, such as <b>Monroe County</b>, a semi-rural area where 45% of the middle-income housholds are housing cost burdened in 2015. In Monroe, the burdened homeowning households far outnumber the burdened renting households. A similar ratio of burdened homeowners to renters occurs in the more suburban <b>Bucks County</b>, with 50% of the middle-class experiencing housing cost burden overall.<br><br>

            The distributional effects of housing cost burden over time should guide Harrisburg policymakers in their efforts to support Pennsylvanians as the state urbanizes and the middle class changes.<br></p>
